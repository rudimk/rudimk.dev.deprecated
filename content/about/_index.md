hello. i'm rudraksh, but you can call me rudi.

i'm primarily an infrastructure and data engineering specialist. i help companies architect their infrastructure and data engineering stacks for maximum performance, resilience and flexibility. containers? infrastructure-as-code? cloud architecture? tensorflow pipelines? cloud cost optimisation? i'm you're guy.

right now, i'm the vice-president of research and development at a quaint company called [indiqus](https://indiqus.com), where we help set up public, private and hybrid clouds for a variety of enterprises and telecom groups. we also do a lot of cloud architecture consulting and delivery for a lot of companies, and that's where i roll right in.

i'm a major history buff - european and west asian history really interests me, especially the ottoman empire, its dissolution and subsequent developments in west asia. and i'm a major progressive rock and indie music consumer - artists like the national, alt-j, porcupine tree, steve wilson, japanese breakfast, slowdive, thievery corporation, amber run, metric, pink floyd, gregory alan isakov and iron and wine are what you'd typically find on my apple music playlists.

feel like getting in touch? tweet out to [@rudrakshmk](https://twitter.com/rudrakshmk). maybe soon i'll have a plain old contact form here.
